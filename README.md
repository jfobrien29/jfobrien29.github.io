# THE JACK O'BRIEN PERSONAL SITE
Congratulations if you've found your way here!

I somtimes tailor my "website" for the companies I am applying to.

Someday I'll build a feature to detect if users on my site are from a specific company
and then tailor the content to them, but for the time being I'm doing it manually! And for
free on github!
